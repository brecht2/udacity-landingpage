// Add class 'active' to section when near top of viewport

/** ### It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

You need to add an active class to a section and also the corresponding link when it is in window view.
Also remove the active class from the section and link when it is no longer in view.
Suggestion: Attach a scroll event to the window object, then when a section is in browser view add the active style to the class of that section. When no longer in view, remove the active style.
A good tip is to have a measurement that will help you calculate the window view. I have provided `getBoundingClientRect()` as one method to use. 

- Are you listening for an event for sections to become active?
- How are you going to test which section should be highlighted?
- How can we use classList methods to change the CSS being displayed? What about removing that CSS?
- Check the HTML and CSS files to ensure that what you chose is updated in the other locations.

// Scroll to anchor ID using scrollTO event 

/** ### When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

- Add an event listener on the click event
- Add the `preventDefault` behaviour of the link
- Use `scroll()`, `scrollBy()`, or `scrollIntoView()` function to implement scrolling.
- Tip: `scrollIntoView()` is the most simplistic. 

- Which event are you listening for (hint: you were just reading it)?
- There is a default event occurring that we need to stop. How?
- If you donâ€™t recall how HTML page anchors work, read more to figure out which variables you should set.
- There are several javascript methods for scrolling. Which seems like it may be the most simple?
